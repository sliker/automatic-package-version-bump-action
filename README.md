## Usage

To use this action, create a pull request with a title in the following format:

```text
[<type>] <description>
```

Or

```text
type: <description>
```

Where:

`<type>` can be one of the following:

**Patches**:

- fix: A bugfix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Code style changes
- refactor: Code refactor or improvement
- perf: Performance improvement
- test: Adding or modifying tests
- chore: Routine tasks or maintenance
- build: Changes that affect the build of the app
- ci: Changes to CI configuration scripts and files
- revert: Reverting a commit

**Minor**:

- feat: A new feature

**Major**:

- !: A breaking change

`<description>` of the change. Example pull request titles:

- [feat] Add login functionality
- feat: Add login functionality
- [feat!] Deprecate old login functionality

The action will automatically analyze the pull request title, determine the
appropriate version bump type, and update and commit the version in the
package.json file accordingly.

Please note that this action assumes your repository follows the standard
structure with a package.json file. Make sure to configure your workflow to
trigger this action on the desired events, such as a merged pull request.
